          <h2>Code</h2>
          <p>This is a very exciting time in Linux Lite development. We are in the process of producing custom, free software for Linux Lite. Our philosophy is basic code, simple design and minimal dependency. Our applications should be clean, fast and simple. Intelligent, well thought out design with great attention to detail. We use the GPL v2.
		  If you're a developer and would like to help with Linux Lite, have a read through our Ethos <a href="cmd://link?http://www.linuxliteos.com/code.html">here</a>. 
		  We also pay developers to help improve our software, see
		  <a href="cmd://link?https://www.bountysource.com/teams/linuxlite">here</a> 
		  for details.</p>

          <h2>Donate</h2>
          <p>Linux Lite is free and can best be described as a labour of love.</p>
	  <p>The goal of this project is to work on it full time so that we can deliver to you a better operating system with each release. More time, more features, greater options.
